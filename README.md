## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types

## Architecture

### Content Script (`src/content/`)
- Detects products on web pages
- Injects the game overlay UI
- Handles user interactions

### Background Service Worker (`src/background/`)
- Manages sweepstakes logic
- Handles Stripe payment processing
- Stores user statistics

### Popup (`src/popup/`)
- Extension settings and configuration
- User statistics and history
- Stripe account management

### Product Detection Algorithm

1. **JSON-LD Structured Data**: Highest priority, most reliable
2. **OpenGraph Meta Tags**: Fallback for sites without JSON-LD
3. **Text Scraping**: Last resort using regex and heuristics
